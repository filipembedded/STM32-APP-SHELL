### STM32 APPLICATION SHELL TEMPLATE

This project is made with intention to create more rigid, more professional 
template for STM32 projects development based on CMake. There should be fixed 
collection of Low-Level drivers and rigid, constant Hardware Apstraction Layer
above LL layer. 

This project is made with idea of TOTAL ELIMINATION of automatic garbage code 
creation that can lead to unwanted bugs in code. 

There will not be any GUI code generators, I am tired of that.

As the project progresses, there will be developed HAL layer (NOT ST's HAL!) for
all basic peripherals.
